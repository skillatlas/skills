2. Add `tiktok videos trending` or `tiktok hashtags popular` for broader context.
3. Pull `tiktok videos transcript` or `tiktok videos comments` on standout posts for qualitative analysis.

## Important operating notes

- Use `--trim` for list-heavy commands when the user wants a smaller payload.
- Use pagination flags like `--cursor`, `--max-cursor`, `--min-time`, or `--page` when the first response is not enough.
- Use `--region` or `--country-code` when the user cares about a specific market. Trend outputs can differ materially by geography.
- If you already have a TikTok user ID or product ID and the command supports it, pass it to make follow-up requests more direct.
- Prefer URL-based commands for exact lookups and search commands for discovery.
- When the task is analysis rather than raw retrieval, fetch only the minimum data needed and then summarize patterns for the user.

## Example requests that should trigger this skill

- "Analyze this TikTok creator's audience and recent videos."
- "Find trending TikTok videos about cold plunge."
- "Pull comments from this TikTok and tell me the main objections."
