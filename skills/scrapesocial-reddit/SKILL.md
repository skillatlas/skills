# Scrapesocial Reddit

Use this skill for Reddit discovery, content research, comment extraction, and ad intelligence.

## Prerequisites

- A Scrape Creators API key is required for this skill. Get one at [scrapecreators.com](https://scrapecreators.com).

## Quick start

Install the CLI once:

## Goal-led workflows

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lead generation      | Use it for demand-led prospecting and lead qualification by finding communities and posts that reveal active need. It is not a contact-export workflow. | Start with `reddit search`, then inspect strong matches with `reddit subreddits get` and `reddit posts comments`.                                  |
| Influencer discovery | Use it to spot recurring experts, operators, or visible community voices rather than creator-style influencer lists.                                    | Start with `reddit search` or `reddit subreddits posts`, then inspect post and comment authors in the returned discussions.                        |
| Brand monitoring     | Use it to watch brand mentions, subreddit conversations, and recurring complaints or praise.                                                            | Start with `reddit search` for brand terms, then move into `reddit subreddits posts` or `reddit posts comments` where the discussion is strongest. |
| Competitor analysis  | Use it to compare competitor mentions, objections, community fit, and ad activity.                                                                      | Start with `reddit search` for each competitor, then add `reddit subreddits search` or `reddit ads search` when you need narrower coverage.        |
| Content analytics    | Use it to understand which themes, titles, and discussion hooks create traction inside a subreddit.                                                     | Start with `reddit subreddits posts`, then use `reddit posts comments` on representative posts.                                                    |
| Trend research       | Use it when you need fast, cross-community signal on emerging topics, questions, or pain points.                                                        | Start with `reddit search`, then validate which subreddits matter with `reddit subreddits get` and `reddit subreddits posts`.                      |
| Audience analysis    | Use it for qualitative audience analysis from comments, repeated language, objections, and subreddit norms.                                             | Start with `reddit posts comments` on strong threads or `reddit subreddits search` for topic-specific community language.                          |

## Command selection

Choose the command by the object you need:

- `reddit subreddits get`: Inspect one subreddit. Use this first when you need subreddit metadata, need to confirm the exact subreddit, or want a starting point before deeper scraping.
- `reddit subreddits posts`: Pull the feed for a subreddit. Use this for trend checks, post collection, or monitoring what is getting posted in a community over a timeframe.
- `reddit subreddits search`: Search inside one subreddit. Use this when the user already knows the target community and wants topic-specific matches there.
- `reddit search`: Search across Reddit. Use this for broad discovery, demand research, finding discussions across communities, or identifying which subreddits are active around a topic.
- `reddit posts comments`: Expand a specific post into its comment thread. Use this after finding a promising post URL and you need replies, objections, pain points, or discussion detail.
- `reddit ads search`: Search Reddit ads by topic and optionally narrow by industry, budget, format, placement, or objective. Use this for ad research and competitive intelligence.
- `reddit ads get`: Retrieve one specific ad once you already have an ad ID and want the full ad payload.

## Common workflows

### Explore a subreddit

1. Start with `reddit subreddits get` to confirm the subreddit.
2. Use `reddit subreddits posts` to pull the current feed.
3. Switch to `reddit subreddits search` if the user wants only posts about a particular topic.

Example:

```bash
scrapesocial reddit subreddits get --subreddit AskReddit
scrapesocial reddit subreddits posts --subreddit AskReddit --sort top --timeframe week --trim
scrapesocial reddit subreddits search --subreddit AskReddit --query "first job" --sort top
```

### Discover discussions across Reddit

Use `reddit search` first when the right subreddit is unknown or the task is market research, social listening, or idea validation.

```bash
scrapesocial reddit search --query "email deliverability" --sort top --timeframe month --trim
```

### Go from posts to comments

When a search or subreddit listing returns a relevant post, follow up with `reddit posts comments` on the post URL to inspect sentiment and detailed discussion.

```bash
scrapesocial reddit posts comments --url "https://www.reddit.com/r/..." --trim
```

### Research advertising

Use `reddit ads search` for category-level ad discovery and `reddit ads get` when you want the full details for one returned ad.

```bash
scrapesocial reddit ads search --query "project management" --formats VIDEO --objectives CLICKS
scrapesocial reddit ads get --id <ad-id>
```

## Important operating notes

- Subreddit names are not interchangeable with `r/...` or full URLs. Use the subreddit name expected by the command, for example `AskReddit`.
- `reddit subreddits get` is case-sensitive according to the catalog. If a lookup fails, verify capitalization.
- Use `--trim` when you want smaller, easier-to-process payloads.
- Use returned pagination tokens to continue:
  - `--after` for `reddit subreddits posts` and `reddit search`
  - `--cursor` for `reddit subreddits search` and `reddit posts comments`
- Start broad, then narrow:
  - `reddit search` to find communities and candidate posts
  - `reddit subreddits search` once the target subreddit is known
  - `reddit posts comments` once the exact post is known

## What this skill is good for

- Finding real user discussions about a topic
- Monitoring a specific subreddit
- Pulling comments for qualitative analysis
- Discovering pain points, feature requests, and objections
- Researching Reddit ad creatives and targeting patterns

## What not to use it for

- Posting to Reddit or managing a Reddit account
- Moderation actions
- Reddit API app setup
- Real-time streaming; this CLI is request/response scraping
