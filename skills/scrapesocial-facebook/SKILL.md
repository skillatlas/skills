# Scrapesocial Facebook

Use this skill for Facebook research and analysis tasks. It maps the user's goal to the right `scrapesocial` Facebook command.

## Prerequisites

- A Scrape Creators API key is required for this skill. Get one at [scrapecreators.com](https://scrapecreators.com).

## Quick start

- Install the CLI once:

```bash
npm install -g scrapesocial
```

- Ensure authentication is available through `SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY` or `--api-key`.
- Start from the most stable identifier you have:
  - A page/profile URL for organic Facebook data
  - A post URL for a single post, transcript, or comment thread
  - A group URL for community research
  - A brand name, keyword, page ID, or ad ID for Ad Library work
- Prefer a narrow command first, then paginate or deepen only when needed.

## Goal-led workflows

| Goal                 | When to use this skill                                                                                                              | How to start                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lead generation      | Use it to qualify known brands, pages, advertisers, or community-led prospects. It is better for qualification than cold discovery. | Start with `facebook ads companies search` for known brands or `facebook profiles get` for known pages, then expand with `facebook profiles posts` or `facebook ads companies get`. |
| Influencer discovery | Use it to vet known creators or pages surfaced elsewhere and see whether they publish consistently in the niche.                    | Start with `facebook profiles get`, then compare `facebook profiles reels` and `facebook profiles posts`.                                                                           |
| Brand monitoring     | Use it to watch owned pages, groups, and ad activity over time.                                                                     | Start with `facebook profiles posts`, `facebook profiles reels`, `facebook groups posts`, or `facebook ads companies get`, depending on the surface.                                |
| Competitor analysis  | Use it to compare page activity, creative formats, and paid messaging across competitors.                                           | Start with `facebook profiles get` for each page, then use `facebook profiles posts` and `facebook ads companies get` for side-by-side review.                                      |
| Content analytics    | Use it to explain which posts, reels, photos, or ads deserve deeper analysis.                                                       | Start with `facebook profiles posts` or `facebook profiles reels`, then inspect winners with `facebook posts get`, `facebook comments`, or `facebook transcript`.                   |
| Trend research       | Use it for group conversations and ad-library pattern spotting.                                                                     | Start with `facebook groups posts` for discussion trends or `facebook ads search` for creative and message trends.                                                                  |
| Audience analysis    | Use it for qualitative audience language, objections, and reactions. It does not provide demographic audience breakdowns.           | Start with `facebook comments` on representative posts or `facebook groups posts` for community discussion.                                                                         |

## Common workflows

### Page or profile audit

1. Run `facebook profiles get` to confirm the page and collect top-level metadata.
2. Run `facebook profiles posts` for the timeline.
3. Add `facebook profiles reels` and `facebook profiles photos` if the user wants a fuller creative inventory.
4. Open individual posts with `facebook posts get` when deeper analysis is needed.

### Post investigation

1. Start with `facebook posts get --url ...`.
2. If you need the first comments or transcript immediately, add `--get-comments` and/or `--get-transcript`.
3. If the thread is long, continue with `facebook comments`, reusing `--feedback-id` from the post payload when available.

### Group research

1. Use `facebook groups posts --url ...`.
2. Adjust `--sort-by` based on the task:
   - `TOP_POSTS` for what performs best
   - `RECENT_ACTIVITY` or `CHRONOLOGICAL` for monitoring current discussions
3. Keep paginating with `--cursor` until you have enough coverage.

### Ad research

1. If you know the message or market but not the advertiser, start with `facebook ads search`.
2. If you know the brand, start with `facebook ads companies search`, then move to `facebook ads companies get`.
3. Use `facebook ads get` on standout ads for creative details or transcripts.
4. Apply filters like country, status, media type, and date range before paginating widely.

## Working notes

- Many Facebook listing commands return pagination data. Reuse `--cursor`, `--page-id`, or `--group-id` exactly as returned.
- `facebook comments` is much faster with `--feedback-id` than with only a post URL.
- `facebook ads search` is best for theme-based discovery. `facebook ads companies get` is best for advertiser-level collection.
- Use `--trim` on ad commands when you want leaner payloads for downstream processing.

scrapesocial facebook profiles get --url https://www.facebook.com/nasa
